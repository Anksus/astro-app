        The Astronomy club tries to bring out the inner astronomer that has been
        hiding inside for so long. We have three major visions for the club:
        Through our workshops and night sessions we wish to build up curiosity
        and knowledge about the universe around us. Getting the astronomy
        fanatics of the college educated and more comfortable all aspects of
        astronomy from observational astronomy and telescope handling to Radio
        Astronomy and other computational aspects. Propagating the ideas of last
        year and bringing forth new ideas. Asteroid mining was a revolutionary
        idea presented in a competition last year and we wish to propagate it
        further as well as get new ideas. In the following academic year, the
        club will be trying to get its own planetarium for various training and
        research purposes. We are also looking forward to collaborate with
        various other clubs and colleges to bring new and exquisite knowledge in
        the club. The Astronomy club tries to bring out the inner astronomer
